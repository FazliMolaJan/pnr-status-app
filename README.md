This is the repository for applications that can be used to check the PNRStatus of a ticket. We are using third party services or open APIs in order to show the status.

This repository stores all versions of the PNRStatus App. Available as Adobe AIR app (broken due to change in external service changes) and Android app (presently working).

In hindsight this was a bad move as we have the code for all 3 versions of the application. We shall move to different repos in the future.
